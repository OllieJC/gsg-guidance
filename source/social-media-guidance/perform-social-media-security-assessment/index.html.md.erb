# Performing a social media security assessment

  
Please email [securing-gov-services@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk](mailto:securing-gov-services@digital.cabinet-office.gov.uk) if you have any questions or comments.

Follow this guidance if you are a security assurance SME and you are responsible for accessing the security practices around the management and use of your social media accounts at your public sector organisation.

The guidance provides a tested approach and [Report Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0Ay3RwrRmrl3Uy2qtLkdRCWQERZPep54tEOyC56arY/edit) to help you facilitate the security review which were developed based on the [NCSC protecting what you publish guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-protect-what-you-publish) which recommends that you should:

 

1.  Use reputable social media platforms and tools that provide good security features.   
2.  Only authorised staff can publish content.
3.  Make sure there is a content approval process in place.
4.  Set up account access logging and non-repudiation.
5.  Put emergency recovery plans and processes in place and test them.
    

## How to assess your social media security

### Step 1. Identify your stakeholders and scope

Identify the stakeholders who are responsible or accountable for the social media accounts and have the authority to provide responses to the proposed recommendations. In most cases, the stakeholder group includes the ‘Head of the Communications’ or ‘Head of Content and Innovation and ‘Communications Manager’ or ‘Social Media Manager’.  
  
Contact the stakeholders to start your review. You can let them know you would “like to discuss with you the latest [NCSC protecting what you publish guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-protect-what-you-publish) and help you identify and implement potential improvements to avoid potential security incidents”.

Work with the stakeholders to:  
-   clearly lay down the scope of the security assessment in terms of communications or social media teams and respective social media accounts
-   identify who will be responsible for making any necessary security improvements
      
### Step 2. Interview the social media team

You will need to interview the identified stakeholders to understand the existing technical controls and procedures around the social media working practices and get some evidence for your assessment.

NOTE: You can use this [social media assessment workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nqngYkug2x3sd6MUmCC98m6lA_4X2Gd3TiczSqufrQI/edit#gid=0), which includes questions to ask during the interview and allows you to document the responses in relation to the social media security controls being applied.

You may need to carry out more than one interview and follow-up discussions before you get all the information to make the findings and recommendations.

### Step 3. Analyse your findings

You will need to analyse and assess the information and evidence from the interviewees to develop the findings, residual risks and recommendations.

Each security control in the [social media assessment workbook](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nqngYkug2x3sd6MUmCC98m6lA_4X2Gd3TiczSqufrQI/edit#gid=0) should be marked as ‘Met’, ‘Partially met’ or ‘Not met’ based on the information gathered on how the respective control is implemented. Then, select the appropriate residual risk, which will be mitigated by applying the proposed improvements.

### Step 4.  Report back your recommendations

Use this [Report Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V0Ay3RwrRmrl3Uy2qtLkdRCWQERZPep54tEOyC56arY/edit) to formally document the outcome of the review and discuss it with the stakeholders. This report will help you to:  
 
-   outline the scope of the assessment
-   provide a summary of current good practices and security controls in place
-   provide a snapshot of how well the organisation is meeting NCSC principles by using a Red, Amber, Green (RAG) status
-   provide details about any risks and recommendations on how to minimise them
    
Note: To help you make recommendations you should cross reference your findings with the [Using social media securely guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ldS6oOS-mVVTtFNUMOe2MLpzPwHvKQb2iNb3fYJ5-kQ/edit).  
  
We recommend discussing and iterating the Report with your interviewees to agree an action plan for each recommendation.

Step 5. Follow up

Depending on the nature of recommendations, it is essential to set up regular checkpoint meetings with the person responsible for the implementation of the improvement plan to monitor the progression of these improvements and provide direction and advice.
