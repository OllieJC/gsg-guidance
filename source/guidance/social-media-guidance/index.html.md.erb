# Social media guidance

The Central Data and Digital Office (CDDO) has created guidance to help government staff set up, manage and assess the security of social media accounts. CDDO developed this guidance based on the NCSC [protecting what you publish guidance](https://www.ncsc.gov.uk/guidance/social-media-protect-what-you-publish) and the Cabinet Office social media security policy.
